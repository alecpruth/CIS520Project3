---- PRELIMINARIES ----


	PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
	=====================

---- ALGORITHMS ----
	A1.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----
	A2. When a new frame is allocated, the try_frame_alloc_and_lock method in frame.c is eventually called.
In this method, we use a lock to ensure that only one process is allowed to allocate frames at a time.


	PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
	=======================
	
---- ALGORITHMS ----
	B1.

	B2. We decide this by first confirming that the original page fault was caused by a stack overflow,
then we verify that the given address is below the bottom of the current stack.


	MEMORY MAPPED FILES
	===================
	
---- DATA STRUCTURES ----
	C1. We didn't amke any additions in order to finish the memory mapping implementation. 
The provided implementation had all the functionality we needed, and we simply added the code
necessary to get things working. The methods that we altered/added to were:
syscall.c
	sys_munmap
		The unmap system call. Idenitifies the requested mapping in current list of mappings, then unmaps it.
	unmap
		Removes the given mapping from virtual memory and, if changed, writes back to the file system.

---- ALGORITHMS ----
	C2.

	C3.


----RATIONALE ----
	C4.
